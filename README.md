# PiggyBank

## Context

**PiggyBank** is a web application that was made for the Scala course at HEIG-VD.
It is a project made in the end of a semester that has permitted to us to consolidate our knowledge in the programming language **Scala**.

## Description

**PiggyBank** allows you to manage your spendings and incomes in a specific currency.
You just have to create an account with your preferred currency to start using it.

**PiggyBank** offers three major features:
  
  1. You can add borrows and lends to your account to remember how much money you owe to other people and how much money the others owe to you.
  
  2. You can create specific budgets for your needs. A budget is mainly defined by a type that can by an income or an outcome, a persistent value that specify in number of days the time before the budget will be reinitialize, and by an amount.
     
     In addition, you can of course define the name of the budget, a reported value that indicates if you want that the eventual exceeding value will be reported when the budget is reinitialized, and a color to have nice background color for representing your budget. For the the budgets of type outcome, you can specify the budgets from which the money will be levied.
     
     For example, you can have a budget for your salary of type income with an amount of 5000 and a budget for your food spendings of type outcome with an amount of 400 that takes money from your salary budget.
  
  3. To make a sense of defining budgets, you can create transactions that are linked to a specific budget and will automatically update the budget according to the amount of the transaction. Transactions with positive amounts will be associated to income budgets and transactions with negative amounts will be associated to outcome budgets.
     
     For example, if you define a transaction linked to your salary budget with an amount of 50. The application will automatically update the budget by adding the specified amount to the budget. In this case, because the budget is of type income, the amount will be added to the budget and a positive exceeding will be calculated (because, you don't have already define a spending for the outcome budget that takes money from this salary budget). Inversely if you exceed an outcome budget, a negative exceeding will be calculated.

**PiggyBank** has also a nice dashboard that will present you statistics about your spendings and incomes with colored graphics.

## Technologies used

**PiggyBank** was made with the following technologies:

  1. [Scala Play Framework](https://playframework.com/)
  
  2. [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/)
  
  3. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
  
  4. [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/)
  
  5. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

Don't hesitate to read the file **api.yaml** in the root of the project to understand how the REST API works if you want directly to use it.
Feel also free to use the Postman requests that you will find in the [wiki](https://github.com/MathieuUrstein/HEIG.SCALA.Projet/wiki)!

Be aware to change the parameter **play.crypto.secret** in the file **application.conf** with a better secret key before to use this application.
Because it is this value that is used to sign the JWT token used to protect the REST API.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you will only need the following requirement:
- SBT 0.13.15 (last version at the end of the project)

After installing the requirement, go to the root of the project (after a clone of this repo) and first check that you have a folder named **db** with
a file named **piggyBank.db** inside it. It is a SQLite database that contains some examples data. If it is not case, just create an empty folder named
**db** and when you will launch the application with SBT, you will just have to apply a script to create the database (evolution) by pressing a button
in your browser. After that, a clean database will be created inside the **db** folder and you can start using the web application.

To launch the application with SBT, go to the root of the project and execute the following commands:

`sbt`

`clean`

`run`

Normally your default browser will be opened in the following address **http://localhost:9000/**. If it is not the case, go to it manually.
